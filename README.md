# Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning-for-Cancer-Classification-Using-Gene-Expression-Data
This project focuses on the statistical analysis of gene expression data to distinguish between invasive and noninvasive cancer using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in R and provided with a dataset containing 500 gene expression variables and a class label indicating cancer type. The analysis begins with supervised dimension reduction or feature selection to identify the most relevant genes for classification. Various supervised learning models are applied—including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—to predict cancer type. Teams may also explore additional supervised methods and are expected to fine-tune hyperparameters and compare model performance using resampling techniques such as repeated 10-fold cross-validation, jack-knife, or bootstrap. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, are used to identify patterns or subgroups within the gene and patient data, without relying on the class label. These cluster results are then evaluated for their potential to enhance classification models.
