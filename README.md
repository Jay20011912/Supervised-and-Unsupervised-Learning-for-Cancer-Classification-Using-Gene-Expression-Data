# Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning-for-Cancer-Classification-Using-Gene-Expression-Data
This project uses R to analyze gene expression data and distinguish between invasive and noninvasive cancer. It applies supervised methods (LDA, QDA, Random Forest, SVM), unsupervised clustering, and resampling techniques to evaluate models, reduce dimensionality, and improve classification accuracy.
